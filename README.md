Data Analytics Project: Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis
📋 Overview
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using transactional data from 3,900 purchases across various product categories (p. 1). The goal is to uncover insights into spending patterns, customer segments, product preferences, and subscription behavior to guide strategic business decisions.
📊 Dataset
Source: Transactional data from a business.
Rows: 3,900 
Columns: 18 
Key Features: Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Location, Subscription Status), Purchase details (Item Purchased, Category, Purchase Amount, Season), and shopping behavior (Discount Applied, Frequency of Purchases, Review Rating, Shipping Type).
Missing Data: 37 values in the Review Rating column were handled.
🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
Database: PostgreSQL
Visualization: Power BI
Reporting: Microsoft Word / PDF
Presentation: Gamma (AI-assisted PPT)
🚀 Project Steps
1. Data Ingestion & EDA (Python)
Data preparation and cleaning were performed in Python.
Used pandas for data loading and initial exploration with df.info() and .describe().
Handled missing data in the Review Rating column by using the median rating of each product category for imputation.
Renamed columns to snake case and ensured data consistency.
Feature Engineering: Created age_group and purchase_frequency_days columns.
2. SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)
The cleaned DataFrame was loaded into PostgreSQL for structured analysis. Key business questions answered included:
Comparing total revenue generated by gender.
Identifying high-spending customers who used discounts.
Comparing average purchase amounts between standard and express shipping types.
Analyzing average spend and total revenue across subscription statuses.
Segmenting customers into New, Returning, and Loyal groups based on purchase history.
3. Power BI Dashboard
An interactive dashboard was built in Power BI to present insights visually. Key metrics displayed included the number of customers (3.9K), average purchase amount ($59.76), and average review rating (3.75).
4. Final Reporting
A detailed report was created, and findings were communicated through a presentation generated via Gamma.
✅ Results & Insights
Customer Loyalty: 3,116 customers were classified as "Loyal".
Revenue by Gender: Male customers generated more total revenue ($157,890) than female customers ($75,191).
Top Products: Gloves, Sandals, and Boots were the top 3 products by average rating.
Recommendations:
Boost subscriptions by promoting exclusive benefits.
Reward repeat buyers to enhance customer loyalty programs.
Focus marketing efforts on high-revenue age groups such as Young Adults and Middle-aged customers.
